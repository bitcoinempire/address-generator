Bitcoin Empire: To The Moon is a tabletop card game seeking crowd funding on Kickstarter. As well as being an incredibly enjoyable game, the cards have letters and number printed on them enabling the deck to be used as a random number generator with excellent entropy. The Base58 encoded random number can be transformed into a bitcoin address on the official Bitcoin Empire website, however it is a lot more secure to perform this process on an offline machine. Which is why this repository exists.

> Simple rule, if you control the keys; it's your bitcoin.
> If you don't control the keys; it's not your bitcoin.
> Your keys; your bitcoin. Not your keys; not your bitcoin.

A quote from Andreas Antonopoulos.

## Disclaimer

Bitcoin Empire's address generator  is of course offered without any warranty of any kind; if you lose your bitcoins due to a bug in our software, your keystrokes being recorded on a malware-infested XP rig from 2003, a weak passphrase, or even a typo, we are sorry in the most respectful way, but we cannot help you. Of course if you're messing around with bitcoins, you know how dangerous it is.
